Written in Ruby, this is a library to help me manipulate Graphs.

The primary purpose of this library is to practice Ruby and RSpec (so I'll be testing a lot), while also brushing up on my Graph Algs from Data Stuctures and Algorithms (I took it last semester). Why not combine it all, right?

<b>Things I expect to include [NOTE: THIS IS A PROBABLE LIST, not a "be-all-end-all"]</b>

<u>Data Structures:</u>
Undirected Graph (weighted), 
Directed Graph (weighted)

<u>Algorithms:</u>
Dijkstras, 
Koseraju, 
BFS, 
DFS

<b> Expected Class Heirarchy </b>
Directed Graph and Undirected Graph, Undirected will have the same mathods as Directed, except in_degree and out_degree (and in_and _out neighbros will be replaced with "neighbors" and "degree" (both of which exist for both graphs))
Library will also have a "Tools" module that will do cool stuff to graphs (WIP)
